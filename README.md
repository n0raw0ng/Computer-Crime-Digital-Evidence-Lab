# Computer-Crime-Digital-Evidence-Lab
The "Computer Crime and Digital Evidence" labs are designed to build foundational and advanced competencies in digital forensics. Through hands-on exercises, I have learned how to set up secure forensic environments, analyze disk images, extract critical digital evidence, and interpret both system and user activity. Each lab simulates real investigative scenarios, allowing myself to apply forensic tools and methodologies to uncover digital artifacts, trace behaviors, and support potential legal proceedings. The comprehensive approach ensures readiness for practical roles in cybersecurity, digital forensics, and incident response.

`1. Set Up and Manage Secure Forensic Workstations`

Ability to configure virtualized forensic environments using VMware and Kali Linux, ensuring controlled and isolated conditions for digital investigations.

`2. Analyze Disk Images and Extract Digital Evidence`

Competency in examining raw disk images to retrieve deleted files, registry data, and logs, simulating real-world scenarios like data leakage or insider threats.

 `3. Conduct System and User Behavior Analysis`

Skilled in extracting and interpreting system-level information, such as user accounts, installed applications, logon history, and execution traces to reconstruct user activity.

`4. Retrieve and Interpret Web and Application Artifacts`

Expertise in investigating browser and application artifacts—such as history, cookies, cache, and search keywords—from various platforms to trace online behavior.

`5. Use Specialized Forensic Tools and Plugins`

Proficiency in using industry-relevant tools and scripts (e.g., Sleuth Kit, pasco, rip.pl, registry plugins) to conduct in-depth forensic analysis and generate actionable findings.
